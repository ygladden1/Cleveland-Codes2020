  Armstrong’s application had arrived about a week after the deadline. Armstrong’s first mission
  into the space was as command pilot of Gemini 8 in 1966. With this, he became the first civilian
  to fly in space. His second and last space flight occurred three years later in 1969 when he
  joined Aldrin and Collins aboard Apollo 11 for NASA’s first manned mission to moon. Armstrong spent
  about two hours walking on the moon surface, collecting samples and conducting experiments. </dd>
